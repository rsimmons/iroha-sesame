    usage: iroha.py ENTROPY_BITS

Generated passwords are all lowercase letters. While this reduces per-character entropy, it makes them easier to remember and faster to type.

Some good guidelines for password entropy for 1Password users can be found in [this blog post](http://blog.agilebits.com/2013/04/16/1password-hashcat-strong-master-passwords/).
